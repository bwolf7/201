        <h2> A litte about myself</h2>


        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p class="bodyp" id="p1">My name is Brandon Wolf. I am 25 years old orginally
            from Temecula
            California.
            After highschool, I decided
            to take my talents to the United States Navy in 2016.
            I enlisted as an Avionics Electronics Technician (AT) where I got stationed in Virginia
            Beach
            Virginia. I
            spendt 5 years there where I quickly picked
            up rank and ended my time in service as an E6. I saw one deployement on the USS Harry S
            Truman
            where I led a
            group of 10 Sailors to the successful
            repair of 422 avionics items. I had a rough time transistioning back to civilian life after
            deployement. It
            was at that time, I knew I couldnt do it
            again and began my transition out.</p>


        <h3> My experiences since</h3>
        <p class="bodyp" id="p2">
            On my transistion out, I decided to use the skillbridge program to better myself for the civilian life.
            I
            attended Microsoft Software and
            Systems Academy where I learned the fundamentals of Microsoft Azure. The importance of a cloud system
            was
            clear. I quickly found a new passion
            in the world of tech. That was refreshing since I thought that drive had been lost. During the class
            there
            were a few fields that caught my interest
            the most. Azures Blockchain service was the top of the list. The ability to have an encrypted
            peer-to-peer
            service offers so many possibilities. However,
            my limited coding background quickly halted my learning drive. I knew if I wanted to pursue this field,
            I
            would need to be able to code. I used my military
            benefits to attend CodeFellows coding bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h3> Fun Facts</h3>
        <p class="bodyp" id="p3">
            Outside of sitting at my computer, I enjoy going to baseball games. As a SoCal resident, I fell in love
            with
            San Diego. The city is the perfect blend of
            city and beach. I have been going to Padres games since 2013. In the prime of my fandom, I would attend
            multiple games a week. I have a Padres hat from
            their 2016 All Star game that I would wear everyday for the last 5 years. Ive seen them at their lowest
            and
            have gotten the chance to see them now when
            they are finally a competitive team.

            I also like to spend time with family and friends. My sister is my bestfriend and together we go to
            several
            concerts in the SoCal area.
